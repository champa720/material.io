## Contemporary Public Policy

To understand contemporary public policy, you need to understand the three words contemporary public policy.

First, a policy is a plan or a course of action. You probably have several policies yourself. You may have a policy of eating a healthy breakfast every morning or a policy of never missing your favorite team's game. These are personal policies. There are also plans for action addressing issues that affect the public.

Second, public means "affecting all the people." For example, a public park is open to everyone. Public policy refers to actions that affect everybody. Who has the power to affect everybody? Neither individuals nor businesses have this power, but the government does. Therefore, public policy refers to the laws and actions of the government.

Third, contemporary means "current" or "existing now." Contemporary public policy is the policy of today-not policies of the past or the future.

Contemporary public policy really means "current government actions." Read on to investigate the impact that contemporary public policy has on your life.

### Types of Public Policy

There is not just one contemporary public policy in the United States today. There are actually hundreds, or even thousands, of public policies. This is because the government is very large and it addresses many issues, or concerns. We can organize contemporary public policies according to types of policies.

One way to organize public policy is by the level of government-local, state, or national-that is making the policies. Local public policies are made by local governments, such as cities or counties. For example, city governments have policies describing the health codes that must be maintained in restaurants within the city. State governments have polices too. Most states have policies related to income taxes and sales taxes. Policies made by the national, or federal, government affect everyone in the United States. For example, federal policy allows citizens who are 18 years of age and older to vote in elections.

A second way of organizing public policy is by topic, such as health policies, environmental policies, and economic policies. A local government that chooses to implement, or put into practice, restaurant inspections is implementing a health policy. A state government fining a company for polluting would be implementing an environmental policy. The federal government deciding to lower-income taxes would be implementing an economic policy.

Public policies also include agricultural policies, drug policies, and energy policies. There are recycling policies and hiring policies. There are land-use policies and transportation policies. The list goes on and on.

All the policies that deal with people in the United States are domestic policies of the US government. In this context, domestic means "within the country." Because the federal government deals with other countries, it also has foreign policy.

## Who Makes Contemporary Public Policy?

In the United States, the government is accountable, or responsible, to the people. Elected officials make public policy, but the people choose these officials. Your choice of who to vote for has a direct effect on public policy. Millions of people have the right to vote. Each voter helps shape public policy. Every vote counts.

Within the United States, public policies are the work of all three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial). All three levels of government (national, state, and local) make public policies.

Take, for example, one of the greatest changes of public policy in US history: the changes brought by the civil rights movement. The legislative branch (Congress) passed laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The executive branch (headed by the president) enforced these laws and passed regulations requiring desegregation. The judicial branch (the Supreme Court), in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, declared schools segregated by race to be unconstitutional.

All these governmental decisions were influenced by the men, women, and children who marched and protested for civil rights. These people helped shaped public policy.

Public policy issues affect all parts of our lives. Examples include taxes (economic issues), recycling (environmental issues), funding (scientific research), workplace safety (health issues), and public transportation access for disabled people (transportation issues). How can individual citizens in the United States help shape public policy?

Besides voting, you can help shape public policy in many other ways. You can write letters to the editors of newspapers or post comments online to try to convince others of your position. You can join a political party that seeks to implement public policies you agree with. You can join activist groups to work toward certain public policies.

## Evaluating Public Policy

In the United States, public policies are often hotly debated. You will find Americans speaking out on both sides of almost any public policy issue. Should the government implement national public policies to reduce gun ownership? Many Americans passionately argue yes: gun control will save lives. Other Americans fervently argue no: gun ownership is a right.

What about a national public policy that increases the minimum wage? Many argue that the minimum wage should be increased: people cannot live on such small incomes. But some business groups argue against an increase: companies have limited funds to spend on labor.

Name a public policy issue in the area of health, economy, education, or environment, and you will quickly find there are two or more sides to the issue. All types of public policies are subject to debate.

How do you draw a conclusion about what position to take on a public policy issue? A simple three-step process can help.

  1.  Make a two-column table to list the arguments used by each side. The table will help you compare the arguments.
  1.  Examine the evidence each side uses. Just saying something does not make it true; evidence must be used to support a position.
  1.  Distinguish facts from opinions. A fact can be proven. Everyone agrees on facts. They can be checked in research books. An opinion, on the other hand, is a personal viewpoint. It is based on bias, or personal preferences. Opinions cannot be proven. Public policy should be based on facts, not feelings.
