## Who Has Power?

Under the federal system, the central government and the states share political power. The federal government has the power to tax, make war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, it has the right to "make all laws which shall be necessary and proper" for carrying out the powers granted to it under the Constitution. Any powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved, or set aside, for the states.

The Constitution established a general framework; however, the actual relations between local governments and the federal government have grown and changed over time. The general trend has been toward the federal government increasing its power. The rise of a national economy, several major wars, the trauma of the Great Depression, complicated international relations, and serious urban problems have all helped create a strong federal government.

### State Governments

State governments are organized much like the federal government. Each state has a written constitution and a governor, the chief executive officer. All states have a bicameral (two-house) legislature, except Nebraska, which has a unicameral (one-house) legislature. All states also have court systems. However, there are wide variations in how state governments operate. One common trend is toward increased power in the executive branch, headed by the governor.

**Duties and Powers of the Government**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|:-|:-|
| Chief Executive | Sees that state laws are carried out; prepares budget; appoints officials |
| Chief Legislator | Proposes, approves, or vetoes legislation |
| Judicial Leader | Grants paroles, pardons, and reprieves |
| Commander in Chief | Is commander of the National Guard (the state militia) |
| Party Leader | Heads the political party in the state |
| Ceremonial Leader | Represents the state; greets key visitors |

Some functions of government overlap. Both the national and state governments have the power to tax, for example. Both make and enforce laws and establish courts. However, the Constitution denies some powers to the states. A state cannot coin its own money or enter into a treaty with a foreign country. States cannot tax their exports or imports. State laws cannot contradict, or conflict with, the Constitution.

States provide a wide range of public services. They maintain highways and regulate intrastate commerce, which is marketing within the state. States also provide for both education and public welfare. Creating laws that determine the formation and powers of local governments is one of the most important powers of the state. Counties, towns, and cities are the legal units of the states. Many states have strong home rule laws. These laws give the local governments a great deal of freedom to set up their own systems of government.

Many states also provide for direct initiative and referendum voting. A direct initiative allows citizens to draft proposed laws. If citizens can acquire the required number of signatures on a petition, the state's voters decide whether the law is enacted. A referendum allows voters to repeal, or overturn, legislation that has already been passed by voting on that law in general elections. Several states also provide for recall, a special election that permits citizens to vote an official out of office before the official's term is over.

### Local Governments

Local governments include municipalities (cities, towns, villages), counties, and special districts. The governing bodies in towns, villages, and boroughs provide some of the services that cities do but on a smaller scale. Special districts serve schools, public transportation, and housing. Special districts may also maintain parks, bridges, libraries, and airports.

Town meetings were the earliest form of government meetings in the New England settlements of the 1600s. They remain important in regions where towns have the powers usually reserved for counties. At town meetings, voters set aside money to run the town, pass town laws, and determine the salaries of elected officials. Elections at town meetings are nonpartisan, or not related to political parties. The candidate's political party is not named on the ballot. Anyone in the town can attend town meetings.

In a similar way, township government is popular in some northeastern and north-central areas of United States. A township is commonly 36 square miles. Generally townships distribute public assistance and maintain roads. In some states, school administration is part of the township's responsibility.

County governments enforce state laws and perform any additional duties the state may assign. In county governments, power is usually vested in an elected board of supervisors or commissioners. County governments collect taxes, maintain roads, and manage county property such as jails, hospitals, parks, and forest preserves. County governments also protect the public health by passing public health ordinances. Counties record documents such as deeds, mortgages, and marriage licenses. Some counties provide water and sewage services, operate airports, and maintain recreational facilities.

Counties are divided into smaller units of local government. These can include cities, towns, villages, and boroughs. Cities provide services that include police and fire protection, schools, public utilities, libraries, street and sidewalk repairs, and garbage collection.

A city is governed under a charter that is granted by the state legislature. There are three forms of city government. The first is strong mayor/weak city council (the mayor has wide authority to run the local government and to veto council actions). The second form is weak mayor/strong city council (the mayor usually has little actual power). The third is city manager/city council (an elected council appoints a city manager and retains the power to make all policy).
