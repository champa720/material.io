- concept: >
    When only one seller offers a product, the seller determines the price and the level of service. When two or more sellers provide the same product to the same group of customers, the sellers must take customers' wants and needs into account.

- example: >
    Suppose there's one laundromat in your neighborhood. Although its machines don't always work, it is the only place nearby to do your wash. A second laundromat with brand-new machines opens. The first laundromat soon offers free soap. What's behind this "laundry war"? To attract the some group of customers, each laundromat must show why it is the better choice. Customers benefit from the improved service.

## Monopolies and Competition

A market is any place where buyers and sellers can do business. The market can be real, like a shopping mall, or it can be virtual, like an online seller. Market structure describes how a market is organized. Factors that determine the market structure include the number of companies selling a product, the number of buyers for a product, and the number of similar products available. Two types of market structures are monopoly and competition.

Monopoly exists where there is only one seller that provides a product or service. In practice, a pure monopoly does not exist. Instead, the word monopoly has come to mean that one seller controls most of the market. One kind of monopoly is a utility company, such as a supplier of electricity. All residents in an area must buy their electricity from one company.

A company may become a monopoly by setting up a barrier to entry-that is, a condition that prevents competition. For example, a company may patent a drug so no other company can make and sell that medication. A company that has the only access to a diamond mine can prevent other companies from mining diamonds in an area. Patents and access to natural resources are two examples of barriers to entry.

Competition is the opposite of monopoly. Competition is created when many businesses provide a similar product. Competing suppliers do research to determine what customers want, and then they develop products to meet those desires. Competing companies set prices that attract customers and provide good service.

Competition leads to innovation, or original and creative changes. An example is the auto industry, which regularly develops new vehicle models. Buyers compare products, prices, and services. In the mind of customers, competition is often linked with freedom and prosperity. Having many sellers, a wide choice of products, and interested buyers can lead to economic growth and job creation.

### AT&T Reinvents Itself

The story of AT&T is a history of adapting to changing times and advances in technology. In the mid-1870s, Alexander Graham Bell completed his most famous invention, the telephone. Bell obtained US patents for the telephone in 1876 and 1877. With the patents in hand, Bell and two investors formed the Bell Telephone Company to produce and sell his invention. By 1885, the company was known as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

Because AT&T held the patents, only AT&T could manufacture telephones and operate telephone systems in the United States. The company licensed the service providers that brought local telephone service to most of the country's major cities and towns. AT&T had a monopoly on the market for telephones and telephone service.

After Bell's patents expired, the barriers to entry were lowered for anyone who wished to compete with AT&T. Thousands of new telephone companies formed in the United States. However, because these companies were not connected to one another, the customers of one company could not talk to customers of other companies. AT&T provided the long-distance service that linked the independent phone companies.

By 1939, more than 80 percent of US phone service was controlled by AT&T. The company was the dominant provider of phone equipment as well as service. Because there was little competition, AT&T put its innovative efforts into services and products that the company thought were important. However, these innovations were not necessarily what customers wanted.

While AT&T was a monopoly, it did make many technological advances. It pioneered the use of undersea cables to carry telephone calls between the United States and Europe, and it placed the world's first commercial communications satellite into orbit.

The US Justice Department grew concerned about AT&T's control of the market. Twice the Justice Department sued AT&T to restrict the monopoly. The first lawsuit led to the signing of a consent decree between AT&T and the Justice Department in 1956. The decree restricted AT&T's activities to working on the national telephone system and working for the government. The second lawsuit started in 1974 and was settled in January 1982. In 1984, as a result of the lawsuit, AT&T gave up the regional phone companies that provided local phone service.

Although AT&T no longer supplied local phone service, it was still the country's largest provider of long-distance phone service. But AT&T did have competition in the long-distance market. Therefore, the company had to consider demand. It had to attract customers by providing the types of service that customers wanted.

Competition and new phone technology drove down the price of long-distance service. The use of long-distance telephone service soared, partly because of the need to carry data over the Internet. By 2000, there was more data traffic than voice traffic on the AT&T network.

AT&T has reinvented itself many times. It went from being a provider of local telephone service to being a long-distance phone service provider. Now it is a company that provides a mix of voice and data communication.
