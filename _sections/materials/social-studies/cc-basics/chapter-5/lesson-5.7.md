- concept: >
    Productivity and interdependence are fundamental economic concepts. Both productivity and interdependence have a direct effect on the US economy and on the economies of countries around the world.

- example: >
    Have you ever hod a day when you felt good because you got so much done? Perhaps you mailed a package to your brother, got your lawnmower repaired, bought groceries, and cleaned up the garage. To get some of these tasks done, you were dependent on the help of others.

## Production and Products

The root of the word production is produce, which means "to make or create." In economics, something that i.s created, or produced, is called a product. The process of making the product is called production. The production process may take place in a variety of locations. Factories, offices, medical clinics, and barber shops are all production facilities.

There are two types of products: goods and services.

  * Goods are physical objects, such as shirts, smartphones, loaves of bread, and motorcycles.
  * Services are actions or activities that individuals provide for others, such as cutting hair, giving a flu shot, fixing the plumbing, and painting a house.

If you have ever had a car repaired and were charged for "parts and labor," you understand the difference between goods and services. The parts are the goods, and the labor is the service.

## Interdependence in Economics

Understanding the concept of interdependence is fundamental to understanding economics. Inter means "between." Dependence means "relying on someone or something else." Therefore, interdependence means "relying on one another." Good friends are interdependent-they count on each other.

To appreciate how important interdependence is in economics, think about something as simple as a trip to a corner store. The store was built by a local construction company. The building owner rents the space to the store owner. The store owner hires the clerk. The clerk uses a cash register that was designed by an engineer in Korea. You buy a candy bar that was made from cocoa beans grown in Ghana that were shipped by a British transportation company to the United States. The candy was manufactured in Pennsylvania and brought to the store by a trucking company. You hand the clerk a dollar bill printed by the US government. The coins given to you as change are made from metals mined in Canada. You toss the wrapper into a trash bin that will be emptied by a city employee-who is paid money you and others paid in taxes.

Think of all the people, businesses, and organizations that relied on one another for that simple economic transaction (exchange) of buying a candy bar. Not any one of them could have provided the candy bar by itself. Because these people and businesses were interdependent, the candy bar was made, sold, and eaten. The economic transaction was successful.

Now think of the trillions of economic transactions that take place every day around the world. Each one is the result of interdependence. Interdependence has always been part of economics, but it is growing more important all the time. People, businesses, and governments are becoming more interdependent because of computers and the Internet.

## Productivity and Interdependence

![Adam Smith](img/adam-smith.jpg){: .responsive-img .materialboxed }

Adam Smith is sometimes called the father of modern economics. In his book The Wealth of Nations (1776), Smith described a pin factory that employed ten pin makers. Smith wrote that if each pin maker made pins alone, each pin maker could produce 20 pins a day. In total, all ten workers could make 200 pins in a day. However, if the pin makers divided the work-with one worker unrolling and straightening the wire, another cutting the wire, a third grinding the tip, and so on-they could make more pins. A lot more pins. Instead of 200 pins a day, the same number of workers could produce 48,000 pins in the same amount of time.

Smith was describing the advantages of division of labor and specialization. With division of labor, the work of creating the pins was divided among the workers. Each worker specialized in one task. The increase in productivity is astounding. In fact, the wealth of material goods in the modern world has been made possible largely because of the productivity gains brought about by the division of labor and specialization.

Just as interdependence makes it possible to buy a candy bar, the interdependence of specialized workers dividing the work among themselves makes vast feats of production possible.
