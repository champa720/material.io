## [Lesson 7.1: National Economic Performance](lesson-7.1)

A number of indicators can show a country's economic health. These include the unemployment rate, the gro~s domestic product, and the rate of inflation or deflation. Economic growth is based on efficient use of natural resources, labor, and capital goods.

## [Lesson 7.2: Global Markets](lesson-7.2)

Greater economic globalization has meant more companies and workers are involved in the exchange of goods and services between countries.
