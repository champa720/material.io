      American military leaders did not want to get involved in direct action in Bosnia Herzegovina, a country in southeastern Europe, during the early 1990s. They knew the American public would not support direct military action. High-level US Defense Department sources reported that military leaders were well aware of the unpopularity of the Vietnam War. In that war, about 58,000 Americans were killed and some 153,000 were wounded. The war cost more than $140 billion. Because of the lack of public support for the Vietnam War, US military leadership urged the administration to be cautious about direct military involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
